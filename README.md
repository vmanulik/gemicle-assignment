This implementation is by no means complete and perfect, but a brief showcase of my skills.
Here is the list of would be so planned changes and comments I would like notify you about:
* Worker project contains simplified structure as it excessive to build all the layers for the test task. Please, checkas an example an API project hierarchy
* Unit tests would be a certain way to further improve quality of the code 
* Security measures such as bearer token definitely may be a next step
* Task statement "and wait 30 minutes" was a bit unclear so I decided to take it quite literally
* Let`s talk about any other possible improvements on the call, right?
